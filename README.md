This is python challenge Assignment 3
----------------------------------------
Intro
----------------------------------------
Assignment have the analysis result from python Bank and Poll results.
Various methods were used to come to conclusion of final results output files.
Output file for pypoll was tricky and i was not able to do exercise as per requirements.
Although i got the numbers which were need but could not align them as per requirement.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There was great learning opportunity to loop through the data and bring out small values.
Most of the work is done by myself by playing with values and debugging the errors.
References have been provided from where the codes were used in the example.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code was tested and it was giving consistent outputs except out file with not proper format of outputs.
